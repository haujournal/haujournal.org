HAU Books is delighted to launch its third international competition for
manuscript proposals for new, state-of-the-art <span style="text-decoration:
underline;">short monographs</span> in anthropology. Proposals selected for
publication will be published open access in the Malinowski Monographs series,
on HAU Books’ website in addition to being printed and distributed in hard copy
via the University of Chicago Press. The Malinowski Monographs is one of the
last anthropology series in Europe <span style="text-decoration:
underline;">publishing titles in paperback only</span>.

In tribute to the foundational, yet productively contentious, nature of the
ethnographic imagination in anthropology, this series honors the creator of the
term “ethnographic theory” himself. Monographs included in this series represent
unique contributions to anthropology and showcase groundbreaking work that
contributes to the emergence of new ethnographically-inspired theories or
challenge the way the “ethnographic” is conceived today.

Manuscript proposals may be submitted for short monographs (30,000--50,000
words) aimed to develop key concepts or themes of increased relevance (borders,
voice, fitness, mistrust, gambling, nonreligion, sincerity, boredom, friendship,
anonymity, inequality, austerity) or critique classic categories of
anthropological theory (magic, gifts, money, imagination, bureaucracy, play,
belief, ethnography).

Manuscript proposals should include:

- Author’s name, email, affiliation, and a short biography.
- A description of the manuscript (1000 words in length), including a
  working title, proposed aims and scope, and estimated total word
  count.
- A description of the work’s potential audience and market niche.

Proposals should be as precise as possible, and should meet the following
criteria:

- Short-listed authors must ensure that full-length manuscripts will
  be delivered on schedule (July 2018 or earlier), will accord to
  HAU’s style-guidelines, and will be blinded for further review.
- Proposals should contain clear evidence that the resulting
  monograph, if selected, will be authoritative and will meet the
  highest academic standards.
- Proposals or manuscripts should not be under consideration for
  publication elsewhere.
- Works of fiction, guest-edited volumes, and unsolicited full-length
  manuscripts will not be considered.

On the basis of the manuscript proposals received, the Editorial Board of HAU
Books will select a shortlist for further consideration, and will notify authors
to submit a full manuscript for review. Final reports will be evaluated by the
Editor and selected members of the Editorial Board and monographs will then be
nominated for publication.

Proposals should be submitted by **30 November 2017**

Complete manuscripts will be required by **31 July 2018**

Please submit proposals to Katharine Herman, Managing Editor at
<kherman@haujournal.org>. For further details on the book series please contact
the Editor at <giovannidacol@haujournal.org>
