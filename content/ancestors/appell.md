## Description of Interview

In this short interview, Laura W. R. Appell provides us with insights into her life living and working with the Rungus in the Sabah region (Malaysia) of Borneo. Appell is not, in her own words, “a career anthropologist.” Obtaining a Bachelor of Science from McGill University in 1955, her background was in geology and geography. Her ethnographic interests began to grow after meeting anthropologist and future spouse, George Appell, who was then working at the Peabody Museum.

Appell tells us of her time interviewing Rungus priestesses, and we also learn about her roles as housekeeper, wife, mother, and grandmother during fieldwork. Appell’s account of her everyday experiences in the field demonstrates the invaluable contribution of ethnographic knowledge in the social sciences. Appell’s legacy cannot only be found in the monographs and ethnographic accounts she has published, but also in her enduring relations with members of the Rungus community. As she explains in this interview, her next project is translating all her ethnographic work for the Rungus people to use.
