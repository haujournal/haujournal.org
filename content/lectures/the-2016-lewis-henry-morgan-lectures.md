Anthropologist Rupert Stasch’s research focuses on the treehouse-dwelling Korowai people living on the island of New Guinea in Indonesian Papua. Since 1990, they have been visited by fifty film crews and thousands of tourists, who are motivated by the idea that Korowai are a “Stone Age society” living outside of global markets and history. Drawing on ethnographic research with tourists, guides, reality television crews, and Korowai themselves, Stasch describes the vivid fascination that tourists and Korowai people have with each other’s strange characteristics and analyzes the stereotypes that visitors and Korowai project onto each other. Stasch suggests that some participants in the encounter become more aware of the naturalized assumptions of their own thought, while others assert the unquestionable naturalness of their assumptions even more strongly than before.

For the fourth installment of the multimedia feature of the HAU-Morgan Lectures Initiative brings you Professor Stasch’s 2016 Morgan Lectures in video format. See links below the video for the transcript of the lectures.

**Rupert Stasch** is Lecturer in the Division of Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge and Fellow and Director of Studies, Sidney Sussex College. He has long-term fieldwork experience with Korowai people in West Papua, Indonesia, who during the years he has been involved with them have become internationally famous in the mass media and in the tourism industry. His book, *Society of Others: Kinship and Mourning in a West Papuan Place* (California, 2009), is an ethnography of relations among Korowai themselves, centered on how they make forms of otherness the central focus of social bonds. Dr. Stasch is the author of numerous articles in prestigious journals such as *American Anthropologist*, *American Ethnologist*, *Comparative Studies in Society and History* and the *Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute*. He is a broadly-trained sociocultural and linguistic anthropologist whose interests include: kinship and marriage; photography and visual culture; semiotics; ritual; space and time; tourism; state formation at the state periphery; Indonesia, Melanesia, and the Pacific.
