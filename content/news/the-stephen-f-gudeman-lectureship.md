---

The Gudeman Lectureship in Anthropology is a new series that will be hosted by the Department of Anthropology at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in honor of the many years Stephen F. Gudeman was a faculty member who worked in its intellectually open and supportive environment. The Lectureship is meant as a stage for talks in Social and Cultural Anthropology that focus on the following topics: economies in relation to their social contexts, the wider effects of economy on society, the use of ethnography in the study of contemporary life, and the impact of ethnographic research on social theory.
 
The first Gudeman Lecture will be given by Adam Kuper on **Wednesday, 2 May 2018**.

## Deconstructing Anthropology

{{< sideimg src="/images/news/kuper.jpg" alt="Adam Kuper" >}}
Anthropology started out as the science of the savage. It has become the science of the Other. The Other is our opposite number, our alter-ego, ourselves turned upside down. The savage was the last free man, perhaps---at one with nature and the spirit world, an intuitive artist. For Darwin, however, he was little better than an animal; for LÃ©vy-Bruhl, he was pre-logical; in Freudian fantasy, he was polymorphically promiscuous. He has been represented as the binary opposite of Economic Man by Malinowski and Mauss---and, sometimes, by Gudeman.

I will invite you to deconstruct anthropology's most venerable avatars: the savage, the primitive, the tribesman, the indigenous; the man of culture and the civilized person; the rationalist and the irrationalist; the individual and the "dividual". Perhaps we can then make a start on the reconstruction of the discipline.
