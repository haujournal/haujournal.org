## A partnership between HAU, the American Ethnological Society, and L'Homme

Given last year's success,  we are pleased to announced three scholarly organizations and journals, all from different countries and intellectual traditions---the American Ethnological Society (AES), *HAU*, and *L'Homme*---will continue their alliance for the development of anthropological theory: the **Annual Debate of Anthropological Keywords (ADAK)**. The aim is to hold an annual debate around keywords and terms playing a pivotal and timely role in discussions of different cultures and societies. **We are pleased to announce that the second  debate will be held at the 2017 AAA meetings in Washington D.C. with the keyword: HUMANISM.**

Organizers: Carole Macgranahan (Colorado), Giovanni da Col (SOAS), Caterina Guenzi (EHESS), and Cl√©o Carastro (EHESS)

Anthropology: the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities. We have long centered our discipline on the human, posing inexhaustible questions regarding what it means to be human. Recent years in anthropology and allied disciplines have seen the rise of the Anthropocene and non-human actants as key concepts, along with a debate on the "post-human."  What, these scholars ask, have we missed in presuming human life to be not just our sole focus, but also our only one? And yet out current political crisis arguably calls for a revitalized humanism.  In response, we contend that this moment calls for a revisiting of humanism in the discipline. Yet, what it means to be human is not singular. Instead, one of the core teachings of anthropology is that there are multiple ways to be human, including ways to exclude certain individuals and groups from that category. In this second Annual Debate of Anthropological Keywords, we seek to explore the term humanism as existing at the core of anthropology inquiry.
